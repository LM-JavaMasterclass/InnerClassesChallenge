# InnerClassesChallenge

    Created by Laura Macia: May 8, 2018
         Udemy - Complete Java Masterclass with Tim Buchalka
         Challenge: Inner Classes - based off LinkedList challenge (using code from TB)
         
     Open source code using preferred Java compiler, and run. [Note: Do note that not all code in this challenge was
     created by me (LM), and it was rather developed based on code from Tim Buchalka's solution
     ti the LinkedList challenge.]

     Modify the playlist challenge so that the Album class uses an inner class.
     Instead of using an ArrayList to hold its tracks, it will use an inner class called SongList
     The inner SongList class will use an ArrayList and will provide a method to add a song.
     It will also provide findSong() methods which will be used by the containing Album class
     to add songs to the playlist.
     Neither the Song class or the Main class should be changed.
